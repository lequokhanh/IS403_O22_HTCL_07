\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
\indent Cryptocurrency has become a significant and rapidly growing market, with thousands of different digital currencies available for trading. With the rise of cryptocurrency, there has been an increasing demand for accurate and reliable price prediction models. This paper aims to explore the use of statistical models and machine learning algorithms to predict the price of three popular cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin.\\
\indent The price of cryptocurrencies is influenced by a variety of factors, including market demand, investor sentiment, and global economic conditions. These factors make predicting the price of cryptocurrencies a challenging task. However, with the use of statistical models and machine learning algorithms, it is possible to identify patterns and trends in the data that can be used to make more accurate predictions.\\
\indent This paper scrutinizes a comprehensive suite of models, encompassing traditional statistical methods and advanced machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we explore the application of Linear Regression, ARIMAX (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Variables), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Vector Autoregression (VAR), XGBoost, and LightGBM. We will evaluate the performance of these models using historical price data and assess their ability to accurately predict future price movements.\\
\indent Technical indicators provide valuable insights into market sentiment and trends, aiding in predicting price movements. Integrating these indicators into machine learning models offers a promising strategy to leverage the abundant cryptocurrency market data. This study employs various stock market evaluation indicators, such as moving averages and momentum indicators, to derive features for machine learning. The goal is to enhance predictive accuracy by enabling algorithms to identify meaningful patterns.\\
\indent In summary, by using statistical models and machine learning algorithms to predict the price of cryptocurrencies, investors and traders can make more informed decisions and potentially increase their returns. Additionally, these models and algorithms can be used by cryptocurrency exchanges and financial institutions to manage risk and improve their trading strategies.

\section{Related Works}

\indent There have been multiple studies conducted on the use of statistical models and machine learning algorithms for cryptocurrency price prediction. In a article by Gouxuan Son (2024)\cite{b1}, two models that we concerned in three distinct models employed, Xboost and LightGBM, for predicting Bitcoin prices was conducted. Another paper by Ziyang Yuan (2023)\cite{b2} used KNN, XGBoost and LightGBM to predict the price of Gold and Bitcoin Price. Especially, the investigation found that LightGBM is more effective and space-saving.  Haydier, Albarwari and Ali compared  between  VAR  and  ARIMAX  Time  Series  Models  in Forecasting \cite{b3}. The results showed that the VAR model is better than the ARIMAX model for their observed data depending on the MSE criterion.\\
\indent In another article,\cite{b4} the authors compared the performance of LSTM and GRU models in predicting Bitcoin prices. Additionally, they approved that the GRU model was able to capture long-term dependencies in the Bitcoin price data, while the LSTM model struggled to do so. Meanwhile, \cite{b5} compared and proved that LSTM is also better than RNN.\\
\indent Recent research emphasizes the pivotal role of feature selection in developing effective and interpretable models for cryptocurrency price prediction. Huang, Huang, and Ni (2019) \cite{b6} showcased this significance by integrating high-dimensional technical indicators to predict bitcoin returns. Similarly, Mudassir et al. (2020) \cite{b7} employed a machine learning approach using such features for time-series forecasting of Bitcoin prices. These studies underscore the increasing acknowledgment of technical indicators as valuable features in enhancing predictive accuracy within cryptocurrency markets.\\
\indent Based on insights gleaned from numerous prior literature studies, this research aims to predict cryptocurrency prices utilizing a diverse array of predictive models, including Linear Regression, ARIMAX, RNN, GRU, LSTM, VAR, XGBoost, and LightGBM.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Across all three cryptocurrencies, there are remarkable differences in mean values, indicating diverse price levels. Moreover, the considerable range between minimum and maximum values highlights the wide fluctuations in prices, portraying substantial volatility within the market.
    \item The high standard deviation, positive kurtosis, and skewness values suggest non-normal distributions with fat tails and right skewness. This indicates frequent occurrence of outliers and a tendency for prices to be skewed towards higher values, which means the occurrence of high prices isn't significant.
    \item These measures contributes to a summary that it is potential for high profits but also heightened risks when investing in these three cryptocurrencies.

\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Linear Regression}
In statistics, Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that simulates a mathematical relationship between a dependent variable and independent
variables, enabling predictions for continuous or numeric variables.\
A multiple linear regression model has the form:
\[Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X_1+\beta_2X_2+\cdots+\beta_kX_k+\varepsilon\]
Where:\\
\indent\textbullet\ Y is the dependent variable (Response variable).\\
\indent\textbullet\ \(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k\) are the independent (Explanatory variables).\\
\indent\textbullet\ \(\beta_0\) is the intercept term.\\
\indent\textbullet\ \(\beta_1,..., \beta_k\) are the regression coefficients for the independent variables.\\
\indent\textbullet\ \(\varepsilon\) is the error term.
\subsection{ARIMAX}
\raggedright
ARIMAX is a time series forecasting model that combines Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model with exogenous variables. It extends  ARIMA by  including external  predictors  (denoted as  X) to improve  forecasting accuracy.  This model involves  specifying AR, I,  and MA components,  along with the  exogenous variables, estimating model parameters, and making forecasts \cite{b3}.\\
% ARIMA Models are specified by three order parameters: (p, d, q),\ 

% where,\
%     \indent\textbullet\ p is the order of the AR term
%     \indent\textbullet\ q is the order of the MA term
%     \indent\textbullet\ d is the number of differencing required to make the time series stationary\\

An ARIMAX model depicted by the following equation:
\begin{dmath*}
    Y_t = \alpha
    + \underbrace{\beta_1 X_{1,t} + \ldots + \beta_r X_{r,t}}_{\text{exogenous variables}}
    + \underbrace{\phi_1 Y_{t-1} + \phi_2 Y_{t-2} + \ldots + \phi_p Y_{t-p}}_{\text{AR term}}
    + \underbrace{\varepsilon_t - \theta_1 \varepsilon_{t-1} - \theta_2 \varepsilon_{t-2} - \ldots - \theta_q \varepsilon_{t-q}}_{\text{MA term}}
\end{dmath*}

\subsection{Vector Autoregression}
Vector Autoregression (VAR) is a multivariate forecasting algorithm that is used when two or more time series influence each other. \\
It is considered as a generalization of univariate AR models or a combination between the two or more models and the univariate time series models. Each variable in a VAR is explained by its own lagged values and the lagged values of all the other variables in the equation.\cite{b8} The basic VAR (p) model is given by:
\[Y_t=c+A_1y_{t-1}+A_2y_{t-2}+...+A_py_{t-p}+\varepsilon_t\]
Where:\\
\indent\textbullet\ \(y_t-i\): the "ith lag" of \(y_t\)\\
\indent\textbullet\ \(c\) is a k-vector of constants\\
\indent\textbullet\ \(A_i\): time-invariant (k Ã— k)-matrix\\
\indent\textbullet\ \(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_t\): a vector of error terms with \(k\) element\\
In matrix form:\\
\begin{dmath*}
    Y_t=\left[\begin{matrix}y_1\\y_2\\\begin{matrix}\begin{matrix}.\\.\\\end{matrix}\\y_k\\\end{matrix}\\\end{matrix}\right]\ =\left[\begin{matrix}c_1\\c_2\\\begin{matrix}\begin{matrix}.\\.\\\end{matrix}\\c_k\\\end{matrix}\\\end{matrix}\right]+\left[\begin{matrix}\begin{matrix}\phi_{11}\\\phi_{21}\\\end{matrix}&\begin{matrix}.\\.\\\end{matrix}&\begin{matrix}.\\.\\\end{matrix}\\\begin{matrix}.\\.\\\end{matrix}&\ &\ \\\phi_{k1}&.&.\\\end{matrix}\right]\left[\begin{matrix}y_{1,t-1}\\y_{2,t-1}\\\begin{matrix}\begin{matrix}.\\.\\\end{matrix}\\y_{k,t-1}\\\end{matrix}\\\end{matrix}\right]+...+\ \left[\begin{matrix}\begin{matrix}\phi_{11}\\\phi_{21}\\\end{matrix}&\begin{matrix}.\\.\\\end{matrix}&\begin{matrix}.\\.\\\end{matrix}\\\begin{matrix}.\\.\\\end{matrix}&\ &\ \\\phi_{k1}&.&.\\\end{matrix}\right]\left[\begin{matrix}y_{1,t-p}\\y_{2,t-p}\\\begin{matrix}\begin{matrix}.\\.\\\end{matrix}\\y_{k,t-p}\\\end{matrix}\\\end{matrix}\right]+\left[\begin{matrix}\varepsilon_1\\\varepsilon_2\\\begin{matrix}\begin{matrix}.\\.\\\end{matrix}\\\varepsilon_k\\\end{matrix}\\\end{matrix}\right]
\end{dmath*}
\subsection{Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)}
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of RNN designed to address the vanishing gradient problem that can occur with traditional RNNs when processing long sequences. LSTMs achieve this through a more complex cell structure with three gates:
Forget Gate: Determines what information to discard from the cell state.
\begin{dmath*}
    f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)
\end{dmath*}
Input Gate: Controls what new information is added to the cell state.
\begin{dmath*}
    i_t = \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)
\end{dmath*}
\begin{dmath*}
    \tilde{C}t = \tanh(W_C \cdot [h{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)
\end{dmath*}
Output Gate: Regulates the amount of information passed to the output.
\begin{dmath*}
    o_t = \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)
\end{dmath*}
The cell state ((C_t)) and hidden state ((h_t)) are then updated as follows:
\begin{dmath*}
    C_t = f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * \tilde{C}_t
\end{dmath*}
\begin{dmath*}
    h_t = o_t * \tanh(C_t)
\end{dmath*}
